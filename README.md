# python-utils
* Python can be verbose for simple stuff.
* I like the philosophy of progressive enhancement where you have a fundamental tool with sane defaults that covers 
most of the use cases(say 80+%?), and if you need to stray outside of this configuration you can THEN customize the tool.
* Python appears to take the solution of accomodating for all use cases at the outset in many api calls.
* So here's a bunch of python utility functions to slim down extremely common bread and butter functionality and cover the majority of use cases.
* This is a permanant work in progress. Anything goes. 
* These functions should be self-contained (or at most have support functions in the SAME file.) 
    * No cross file reference. 
    * The goal is a base of functions to build from, and copy the file or the function, without requiring the entire framework.
